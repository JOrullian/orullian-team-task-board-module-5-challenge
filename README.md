## Description
This is a simple task board that allows users to input task title, due date and description and the list will populate with tasks. After submitting a task, it can be manually positioned in one of three lanes "To Do", "In Progress" or "Done". Tasks that are nearing expiration or have expired will show up as yellow and red, respectively. The goal of this project is to have a simple and straightforward task board for users. Each task comes with a delete button that will remove that individual task from the entire page.

While creating this task board, I relied heavily on functionality available from JQuery, including, but not limited to: datepicker, draggable/droppable, dayjs. JQuery makes simple projects like this very easy as a developer can pick and choose widgets, ui elements, etcetera and place them in their projects as they like. What I found the most important is keeping the js file well organized with appropriate comments. This allowed me to reference back to const values or functions and quickly remember their locations and purposes and use them later in the code.

I've gained a deep respect for the communities that have developed libraries such as JQuery and Bootstrap. For these resources to be so easily available and easy to use is incredible and it motivates me to contribute to the community in the future. It is important to read thru the documentation to get an understanding of proper implementation. Also, it is important to not do something silly like forget to source the JQuery script in your html.

## Credits

Starter code has been provided by Southern Methodist University Coding Bootcamp and included a foundational index.html file as well as style.css file to cover things not covered by JQuery and Bootstrap css files. The script.js file originally only included function names.

The repo for the original code can be found here: [Original Code Repo](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Southern-Methodist-University/SMU-VIRT-FSF-PT-05-2024-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/05-Third-Party-APIs/02-Challenge/Develop?ref_type=heads)

This project is part of an ongoing coding bootcamp
